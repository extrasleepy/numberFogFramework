<h2>Number Fog Framework</h2>
Creative Code Fellowship Project

This project applies data visualization and drawing into fabric patterns that capture the prevalence, contrasts, and frictions of rapid change as it affects parallel lives in the Bay Area. The fabric patterns are modeled after Dutch Wax Block Print designs which are popular in West Africa and may appropriately be referred to as "African Fabric". Data, derived from sociopolitical concerns (such as changes in property values, transportation, or labor and income) and represented as shape and line, become the fabric backgrounds. The foreground patterns are composed of drawn symbology related to various technologies emerging from the social, economic and political environment in the San Francisco Bay Area. The finished fabrics are intended to serve a similar purpose as some of the designs in West Africa: highlighting objects as windows into change.
